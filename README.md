I need help to make this IDE, so if you have an idea or want contribute, all help is welcome.

OBS: To work properly run it on 1200x800 screen resolution in landscape.

Objectives:

Syntax highlighting,
Code completion (incomplete, need fix some bugs),
C header parser for extract functions and structs from .h file (working),
C compiler (GNU compiler or android gcc),
Command line,
File browser,
Upgrade UI design.
